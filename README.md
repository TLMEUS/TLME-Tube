# TLME-Tube
This is my YouTube clone. It was created during an Udemy class to help teach me how to work with a video sharing service. I have modified it from
the class using another class from Udemy by using a framework I created in that class.

While I do write my software as a source of income, I feel I would not be here if it were not for all the software authors I have learned from over the years. So I am putting my completed projects here for others to learn from. Full ownership of the software contained in this and my other repositories is retained by myself. If you find something in my software you feel you could use, please email me at owner@troylmarkerenterpreises.com, and we can discuss arrangements for your use of it.
